3,Novel Coronavirus Cases Confirmed To Be Spreading,"The first two coronavirus cases in Europe have been detected in France, and a second case has been confirmed in America as China expands its efforts to control its outbreak. Travel bans have been put in place and extended from central China to effectively put tens of millions of people in local lockdown. The virus was first detected in Wuhan where workers are racing to build a thousand bed hospital to treat patients affected by the disease. All around China, including in the capital Beijing authorities are cancelling all temple fairs and festivals that would accompany the Spring Festival to avoid having large public gathering which would create the perfect scenario for the airborne virus to spread further. More than 830 cases of coronavirus infection have been confirmed, at least 26 people have died, and another 8,420 people are reported by be under quarantine and observation for possible infection after",0
6,Corona Virus 2020: A Global Pandemic?,"Article courtesy of: Carol Petersen RPh CNP Influenza (flu) is defined as an acute, commonly epidemic disease, occurring in several forms, caused by numerous rapidly mutating viral strains and characterized by respiratory symptoms and general prostration. (1) The flu has a major impact on the lungs. Colds start in the nose and upper respiratory tract. Vomiting and diarrhea are assigned to yet another viral family. Corona Virus We are currently in the grip of a media frenzy and potential public health disaster. A new type of corona virus has emerged from a large city in China, Wuhan, and the world is bracing for an impact of a major epidemic. We have been here before, however, we have already experienced MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) along with the same specter of massive numbers of deaths. Corona viruses are thought to be generally mild and not",0
7,Natural Ways To Combat Flu Virus Symptoms,"Influenza is caused by a virus, and there are several kinds that can give you the flu. While there is no cure for the flu, there are ways both pharmaceutically and gentler more natural approaches to help soothe flu symptoms that may help to shorten how long you are sick. It is very important to drink plenty of water and other fluids, especially when you are not well to help your body loosen and get rid of built up mucus and phlegm to clear away. It is also very easy to get dehydrated when you are not feeling well and are not drinking or eating normally. In addition, fever, diarrhea, and vomiting can cause water loss. To help your body stay hydrated other than drinking water you can also drink coconut water, herbal teas, fresh juice, soups, broths, and consume fresh fruits and vegetables. You will be able to tell",0

10,How Viruses Easily Infect People Via Their Eyes & During Outings,"Viruses can survive outside of the human body for varying lengths of time after being expelled from the infected host. First the nasty will remain inactive in a non-hostile liquid, wet or moist medium, when that environment dries out the virus can then remain dormant in a dry state for weeks to months depending on the type of virus. Viruses are expelled out from an infected body into the air after a person sneezes or coughs. Unless covered up a sneeze can eject at over 100 miles per hour and as many as 50,000 individual aerosolized micro droplets of saliva and other moisture can be expelled to travel for a distance between 19-16 feet according to research from MIT. Uncovered aerosolized blasts of mist expelled from the cough or sneeze will be carrying viruses and bacteria, each of these droplets can hang in the air for minutes or longer depending",0
11,Antiviral Developed Using Sugar,"Antiviral materials have developed in collaboration by a team of international scientists using sugar that has been designed to destroy viruses on contact which may be useful against viral outbreaks; scientists from the Universities of Manchester, Geneva, and the EPFL in Lausanne are in the early stages of developing the broad spectrum activity of the antiviral material which could also be effective against newly prevalent viral diseases such as the coronavirus. The new antiviral shows promise for treatment of herpes simplex, respiratory syncytial virus, HIV, hepatitis C, and the Zika virus among others; and it has been demonstrated to be successful in treating a range of viruses in lab studies including genital herpes. Virucidal substances such as bleach are typically able to destroy viruses on contact but they are toxic to humans, meaning they canât be taken or applied to the body without causing harm; creating virucides from sugar has",0
12,"Coconut Oil's History in Destroying Viruses, Including Coronaviruses","Comments by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News People living in the Philippines, a country of islands not very far off the coast of China, remember all too well the last time a deadly coronavirus epidemic broke out in China. It was 2003 when the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus broke out in China. It infected over 7000 people in China with over 600 recorded deaths. Even with its close proximity to China and large Chinese population in the Philippine nation of about 80 million people, only 14 cases of SARS was reported with two recorded deaths. Canada, many thousands of miles away, had far more cases and more deaths recorded due to SARS infection from China than neighboring Philippine Islands. One of the theories put forward at the time as to why the Filipino people had so few cases, was the countryâs predominant use of cooking oil: Coconut",0
13,Are Officials In China Downplaying Infection Numbers?,"Some agencies are reporting that officials in China are keeping two sets of coronavirus infections numbers: a set they let the public see, and the actual numbers. Recently this infectious disease has been spreading globally, and experts have been warning that China has been significantly understating the true numbers of infections and deaths caused by the coronavirus. Now apparently evidence has emerged that allegedly supports those sentiments, and this evidence appears to indicate that officials in China are keeping two sets of numbers regarding what they want the public to know about the numbers of infections and deaths and the actual numbers. âAs Taiwan [News] reports in a report first spotted by user @TheHKGroup, over the weekend, Tencent âseems to have inadvertently released what is potentially the actual number of infections and deaths, which were astronomically higher than official figuresâ, and were far closer to the catastrophic epidemic projections made",0
16,Global Research Pushes Molecular Medicine Therapy for Coronavirus Treatment,"Scientists are working night and day, racing to find a cure for the novel coronavirus; and an East-meets-West combination of medicines is now suggested to be the recommended course. Health authorities in the Republic of China are focusing more and more on millennia-old traditional medicines to treat the novel coronavirus which has so far reportedly killed more than 630 people and infected over 32,000 worldwide. It has been reported that eight patients infected with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia have been treated and cured by a combination of TCM and Western medicine in Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, which is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. The patients were discharged from the hospital on February 4, 2020. They are the first batch of patients cured by such a hybrid treatment in the hospital, one of the designated institutes admitting patients infected with the virus in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province.",0
17,CDC Expert Says Coronavirus Is Not Controllable & Will Spread,"CDC intelligence officer, researcher, and vaccine deployment expert admits to the coronavirus pandemic being beyond control and that it will spread globally. Although some of the media is trying to downplay the coronavirus pandemic, and some even suggest that it is not real, footage is being leaked, and some establishment scientists are even warning that this outbreak may not be able to be contained. Dr. Nancy Messonnier works for the CDC and previously was an epidemic intelligence officer with the Deputy director for Infectious Diseases under the CDC, as well as being an anthrax researcher and an African vaccine deployment expert. Messonnier was quoted as saying,âWe are preparing as if this were the next pandemic,â and reiterating that it, âwould be impossibleâ to fully contain the virus and prevent the outbreak from spreading. Her word-for-word quote from Bloomberg reads: âTotal containment isnât in the cards, said Nancy Messonnier, director of",0
18,Donât Die From The Flu,"Article courtesy of: Carol Petersen, RPh, CNP Viruses have been with us since the dawn of man. An estimated 380 trillion viruses can infect the human body at any one time. (1) Human biology is exquisitely tuned to defeat viruses or to coexist with viruses as part of the human viome. Our relationship with microbes is vibrant and sometimes a fight for one-upmanship. (2) Our existence is a testament to our ability to manage viral loads. The pharmacopeias of the world, of some 500,000 different drugs, contain long lists of substances which have antiviral, antibiotic and immune boosting substances. This list alone of antiviral drugs (3) is impressive. It is almost certain that within the realm of the worldwide knowledge of substances, that some would exist which would counter the threat of the coronavirus and any other virus that overwhelms us. Given the threat of global viral pandemics, how can",0

21,Reducing Diagnostic Time Of Coronavirus,"The coronavirus is showing no signs of slowing down, making it important to improve the current method of diagnosing it which can take an hour or longer. Now, a new technology based on a combination of optics and magnetic particles can test 100 samples and reduce the diagnostic time down to about 15 minutes. Currently there are over 80 reported clinical trials running in China to test possible coronavirus treatments, and the first new case has been reported in Africa, prompting concern over the spread of the virus after arriving in countries that may be vulnerable due to economic status or political instability. According to Dr. Amos Danielli of the Alexander Kofkin Faculty of Engineering at Bar-IIan University this new technology can carry out saliva test analysis within 15 minutes, and the technology has already been proven to reduce diagnostic time of Zika virus and it is being used in",0
22,The Next Frontier of Mitochondrial Medical Applications (2020),"Becoming the world's most advanced and largest professional mitochondrial technology and manufacturing leader is the vision of most biotech companies in the field of mitochondria and mitochondrial research, and preventive medicine. Mitochondrial disorders are multi-systemic and commonplace, and it belongs to a prevalent category of inherited neurometabolic diseases (prevalence: 1:4300). Such diseases are clinically, genetically and chemically heterogeneous so that recognition and diagnosis are frequently difficult, but thankfully, for most of the patients, recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has led to great improvements in genetic diagnosis. Due to the variability of features and nature of the biochemical or genetic defects, early referral to a specialized center is recommended because improved diagnostics and NGS use have enabled an earlier diagnosis for many, as well as sometimes early instigation of effective therapy and precision medicine. There is currently no cure available for the majority of such conditions, and clinical care",0
23,Coronavirus Infections May Be Going Undetected,"A new study from Imperial College London researchers based at the W.H.O Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Analysis, and J-IDEA-Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics suggests that nearly two thirds of new cases of COVID-19 have gone undetected. Sangeeta Bhatia, author of the 6th report explained in a statement that, âWe compared the average monthly number of passengers traveling from [outbreak epicenter] Wuhan to major international destinations with the number of COVID-19 cases that have been detected overseas. Based on these data, we then estimate the number of cases that are undetected globally and find that approximately two thirds of the cases might be undetected at this point. Our findings confirm similar analyses carried out by other groups.â Previous research has shown that only a small subsection of confirmed cases display serious symptoms such as pneumonia, and globally researchers are working to understand how the virus spreads",0

27,Americaâs First Case Of Community Spread Coronavirus,"An American with no history of travel to outbreak hotspots or exposure to another person that is infected with the coronavirus has been diagnosed with the disease, according to the CDC announcement this is very likely the first case of community spread inside of the United States. According to the announcement the patient was admitted to UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, California on February 19, 2020 from another hospital, but the patient was not diagnosed until 4 days later. The hospital called in the CDC to do the testing because they are not capable of doing so which is what caused the delay. The hospital released a statement saying that the patient was placed under âstrict contact precautionsâ and believed there âhas been minimal potential for exposure here at UC Davis Medical Center.â Additionally some of the hospital staff have been asked to stay home and monitor their condition/temperature",0
31,Orange County Declares Local Health Emergency,"Orange County, California has declared a local health emergency in response to the coronavirus, and the county may now be set to start testing patients exhibiting flu-like symptoms for COVID-19. The announcement is in response to a proposal to move patients with coronavirus to a facility in Costa Mesa. However, the proposal has created a court battle, and at the center of the dispute is the proposal to use the Fairview Development Center as a quarantine site, this is what drew fierce and swift condemnation from officials representing the area. âThe county of Orange continues to support Costa Mesa in opposition of state and federal governmentâs decision to move COVID-19 patients to the Fairview Center,â Andrew Do the Vice Chairman of the Board of Supervisors said. But he notes that transportation of patients to these locations does not âpreserve the health of our community,â of over 3 million people. Costa",0
