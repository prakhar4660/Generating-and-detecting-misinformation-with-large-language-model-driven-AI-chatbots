35,New Compounds Fight Multiple Viruses,"According to a report in ACSâ Journal of Medicinal Chemistry researchers have discovered compounds that are capable of blocking replication of similar coronaviruses as well as other disease causing viruses; but the compounds have not been tested in humans yet. 2019-nCoV is a close relative to SARS as well as MERS-CoV, all of these viruses cause flu-like symptoms as well as frequently leading to pneumonia, and there have not been any effective treatments developed as of yet. Rolf Hilgenfeld, Hong Liu and colleagues are working to develop a broad spectrum antiviral that can target all coronaviruses as well as enteroviruses, all of which share similar protein cutting main protease enzymes in coronaviruses and the 3C protease in enteroviruses that are essential for the viral replication. X-ray crystal structures of the proteases were examined which was followed by creating a series of a-ketoamide compounds that are predicted to fit in the",0
36,INFO TO PROPER PARTIES TO ASSIST WITH CORONAVIRUS CONTAINMENT,"Article Written by: Robert M. Goldman MD, PhD, DO, FAASP Plan To Mitigate The Foreign Born Viral Coronavirus Invasion To America There are simple and straightforward methods to blunt the coronavirus effects on America, given what we know about the spread of this virus, specific actions need to be implemented immediately. The facts are that the virus cannot spread without it getting access to a victim's mucus membranes via eyes, ears, and nose. Staff on airplanes and other public transport in high-risk situations of coming into contact with those who are infected, should be issued simple reusable masks and gloves made from an ion infused copper cotton material that is anti-viral on contact. The cotton should be infused with copper ions which kill viruses on contact, and thus wearing a copper infused cotton mask with or without an N95 or N99 filters are a superior protection choice. Prevention of mucus",0
38,"COVID-19 Newest Prevention Method: ""Dynamito Mitochondria""","Article courtesy of Kenneth Kwok Co-President of Asian World Anti-Aging And Well-Being Association as well as the Founder and CEO of Global Citizen Capital; along with HanChung Cheng Chairman of MitoBioMed. The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a large-scale outbreak. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the SARS outbreak in 2002 because the viruses have high genetic similarity. During the infection, SARS-CoV-2 represses the repair function and defense ability of lung macrophages, causes severe respiratory symptoms and acute lung damage, and even immediately causes death of infected patients. COVID-19 and its First Line of Defense - Macrophages Lung macrophages are important immune cells that protect against foreign pathogens when the lungs face bacteria and virus infection by using phagocytosis. Therefore, lung macrophages digest, degrade and remove these foreign objects and further activate the adaptive immune system to fight against unknown infection. Mitochondria are a major contributors to phagocytosis",0
39,The Missing Narratives in the Debate for Medicare for All,"Written By: Richard Gale and Gary Null PhD March 4, 2020 The onslaught of misinformation from the corporatist wings of both political parties and media biases against universal healthcare are obviously confusing the electorate. This is seemingly evident in this week's Super Tuesday with Joe Biden winning the majority of the states. This confusion leaves citizens bewildered about how they will pay their bills unless a fundamental overhaul of medical insurance is undertaken. More importantly, what will happen when you are diagnosed with a serious illness and are not fully covered? What are your chances of joining the ranks of the 530,000 families that file bankruptcy annually for medical reasons? According to a study published last year by the American Journal of Public Health, 66.5% of bankruptcies are medically-related. In the past, it was rare for people to go bankrupt because they did not have accessible medical care. There was",0
40,Official Statement From China For Recommended Treatment Of COVID-19 Using Vitamin C,"Confirming the reports from small independent studies and 3 clinical trials, a Shanghai hospital has announced a recommendation to use high dose intravenous treatment of vitamin C to treat COVID-19, according to the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service. The announced official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high doses of intravenous vitamin C come as welcomed news as the virus continues to spread. The dosage recommendation will vary with the severity of illness ranging from 50-200 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to as much as 16,000 mg/kg/day. *Note: ""Using Vitamin C"" was added to the title on April, 13, 2020. The doses are ranging from approximately 4,000 to 16,000 mgs for an adult which is administered by an IV. Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD who is President of the Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy states that this specific method of administration is very important because vitamin Câs effects are",0
44,Mutation Which Makes Coronavirus Extremely Infectious,"While most of the mainstream is insisting that COVID-19 is not man made, rather a naturally occurring mutation, recent research from Europe and China has revealed that this disease happens to have an HIV like mutation which allows it to bind with human cells up to 1,000 times stronger than the SARS virus, according to SCMP. In January 2020 a team of scientists wrote a paper that has since been retracted claiming that this coronavirus may have been genetically engineered to contain parts of the HIV genome, in the report they wrote: ""This uncanny similarity of novel inserts in the 2019- nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature,"" in other words they are suggesting that it is unlikely to have occurred naturally. Fast forward to more recently new research from Nankai University in which the team writes that this COV-19 has an",0

50,Would You Be Willing To Be Voluntarily Infected With Coronavirus?,"Apparently researchers are looking for volunteers to be deliberately infected with strains of the coronavirus. Research in the UK are offering about $4500 in exchange for two weeks in a secure London facility that has a TV, Playstation gaming, WiFi, and a private bathroom to those who volunteer to be infected. 24 human volunteers are being sought after to infect with coronavirus strains 229E and OC43, while they are similar to COVID-19 they only cause a mild respiratory illness. Once infected a research team will be collecting samples such as nasal and blood, and all dirty tissues will be collected by a trained medical staff to assess the viral load. Those who volunteer to be human test subjects will be closely monitored 24/7 for symptoms, the researchers will control your diet, and you will be barred from exercising as well as having contact with the outside world along with being",0
55,A Scientific Look at Botanical Plants and Supplements Against Coronavirus,"Written by: Richard Gale and Gary Null PhD Progressive Radio Network, March 10, 2020 In recent weeks, the coronavirus pandemic has dominated the news at the expense of everything else that is critical and urgent in our lives. As panic increases and more cases are reported daily, health-minded people are eager or even desperate to know whether there are ways to strengthen the body's immune system to offer some protection from this specific upper respiratory infection. There are six known strains of coronavirus, four which are associated with the common cold or moderate respiratory infections. Everyone has likely had a coronavirus infection at some time in their lives. However, two strains -- Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) -- are much more severe. Between the years 2002-2004 and 2014-2018 these strains respectively were observed to be lethal. However, during this periods, total deaths were",0
56,Puzzle Game Aims To Crowdsource A COVID-19 Cure,"A University of Washington coronavirus puzzle game has been designed which is aiming to crowdsource a cure in a novel approach to combat the spread of COVID-19 globally. Their puzzle game challenges scientists as well as students and the public alike to build a protein that can block the virus from infiltrating human cells. This puzzle game is on Foldit, which is a 12 year old website created by the universityâs Center for Game Science that was designed to crowdsource contributions to important protein research from over 200,000 registered players. According to the University the most promising ideas that are generated from the game will be tested and possibly be manufactured by UWâs Institute for Protein Design in Seattle. COVID-19 is short for Coronavirus disease 2019, and it is spreading around the globe infecting thousands of people and accumulating an increasing death toll as it moves. The title of coronavirus",0
57,Risk Factors For COVID-19 Related Death Identified,"Based on patients admitted to the hospital and confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 the key risk factors for death are: signs of sepsis, blood clotting issues, diabetes, heart disease, and advanced age, according to a new retrospective study published in The Lancet evaluating data record for 191 patients of which 54 did not survive and all patients had been admitted to one of 2 hospitals in the epicenter of Wuhan, China. âMultivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and d-dimer greater than 1 Î¼g/L on admission,â the studyâs authors wrote; age range for survivors was 45-58; that for non-survivors was 63-76. This study also provided new findings on viral shedding which indicate that the median duration of viral shedding was 20 days in survivors ranging from 8-37 days and that the virus was detectable up until death",0
