67,Peddling Disinformation on COVID-19,"It appears as if fact checkers are becoming even more occupied as well as scientists and experts who are scrambling to correct incorrect statements which are naturally being amplified by partisan media, propagandists and some officials globally. From the moment COVID-19 hit some of the global administrations have appeared to be determined to portray an alternate reality around this outbreak. Using some of the incorrect information that has been provided the COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus that is no worse than the seasonal flu, and some of those responses claim that it this a hoax and media coverage of the virus is nothing more than a part of a political conspiracy. Much of this messaging and narrative comes from tossed off tweets, impromptu public statements, and public announcements. In reality global health officials are raising growing concerns about the outbreak and efforts to play down COVID-19 which",0
76,PODCAST: Panic Is a Terrible Idea â Talking Wuhan Virus (Coronavirus or COVID-19) and Some âOn Themeâ Music Vids,"It was a lot of fun to be a guest on the great Conservatarians podcast at Ricochet on Friday with my friend and host Jon Gabriel, @ExJon, the âUndisputed King of Stuff.â Jonâs description of the podcast is below, and listen to it in the player above. Preparation for Coronavirus is essential. Panic? Not so much. Jon welcomes his old friend from the blogging trenches Jim Lakely, now the Vice President and Director of Communications of the Heartland Institute, to discuss the mediaâs abysmal job at covering a pandemic. Prior to joining Heartland, Lakely spent 16 years in daily-deadline journalism, covered Capitol Hill, and was a member of the White House Press Corps for The Washington Times. Follow him on Twitter! The intro/outro song of the week is, of course, âPanicâ by The Smiths. To listen to all the music featured on The Conservatarians this year, subscribe to our Spotify",0
84,FDA Gives Green Light To 2nd Commercial COVID-19 Test,"The FDA has quickly given the OK to the second commercial COVID-19 test from Thermo Fisher after granting an Emergency Use Authorization to the first commercially developed test from Roche for use of the high throughput cobas system. According to the FDA both tests were given the green light within 24 hours of receiving their applications, this allows for immediate use of Thermo Fischerâs TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit on its Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx real time hardware within certain laboratories across America. The company says the test is designed to detect the specific nucleic acids from the SARS-CoVp2 virus to provide results within just 4 hours including the time required to prepare the sample and conduct analysis. ""The authorization of our diagnostic test for COVID-19 will help to protect patients and enable medical staff to respond swiftly to treat those who are ill and prevent the spread of infection,""",0

89,Common Drugs That May Confer Higher Risk For COVID-19,"It is known [1] that coronaviruses bind to target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2. COVID-19 attaches and binds to target cells through ACE2 protein sites on cells of the lung, intestine, kidneys and blood vessels. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 sites are increased [2] by Ibuprofen, antihypertensive medications such as ACE inhibitors, ARBS, Thiazolidedinones, as well as type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The most frequent comorbidities include diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular diseases that have been reported thus far in those with COVID-19, and these are typically treated with ACE inhibitors, although this was not mentioned in the studies. The higher level of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 may increase infection with COVID-19 and consequently may also increase the risks for both severe and fatal infection of the COVID-19 virus. However, antihypertensive calcium channel blockers [3] donât increase ACE2, and should be taken into consideration as a possible",0
96,Drug Used In Japan Showing Promise Against COVID-19,"A drug used in Japan to treat influenza appears to be effective in treating COVID-19, according to reports doctors have found clear evidence that it improves coronavirus symptoms. Favipiravir/Avigan is an antiviral that has been showing positive outcomes in clinical trials involving 340 patients in Wuhan and Shenzhen according to a statement made by Zhang Xinmin in a report in The Guardian. ""It has a high degree of safety and is clearly effective in treatment,"" Zhang said. Favipiravir/Avigan was developed by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical and is being manufactured by Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical; and it recently received approval as an experimental treatment for COVID-19 infections, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Shenzhen patients positive for COIVD-19 who were given the drug tested negative only 4 days after administration, as compared to a negative test 11 days later for those with no drug treatment. Additionally, lung conditions as shown in X-rays improved in 91%",0
109,Russian scientists decipher COVID-19 and take a photo of it,"Russian scientists decipher COVID-19 and take a photo of it Russian scientists managed to completely decipher the first complete genome of the new coronavirus, which they received from an infected patient, a message posted on the website of the Russian Healthcare Ministry sad. The breakthrough achievement was made by specialists of the Research Institute of Influenza named after A.A. Smorodintsev. Chief researcher of the institute, Dmitry Lioznov, said that genome sequencing would help to understand the evolution of the virus and the dynamics of its spread. It will also be helpful in the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs for the treatment of coronavirus. The information, which the Russian scientists have been able to obtain, was sent to the WHO database so that other research groups could have access to it. The scientists took a photo of the coronavirus. The photo was taken by the staff of the laboratory of",0
110,Russia reports first COVID-19 death: Woman dies of pneumonia,"First COVID-19 death reported in Russia The Russian authorities have reported the first death of a coronavirus-infected patient in Russia. The elderly woman was hospitalized on March 13, and was soon moved to intensive care. The patient suffered from many chronic diseases, and doctors could not save her life. In Moscow, a patient who was diagnosed with a new coronavirus died as a result of severe pneumonia due to concomitant chronic diseases, representatives of the Moscow operational headquarters to combat the coronavirus said. The 79-year-old woman was hospitalized on March 13. She was initially sent to a private clinic, but after she was tested positive for coronavirus, she was transferred to Moscow's Infectious Diseases Hospital No.2. ""Due to increased respiratory distressed, she was receiving complex intensive care therapy. The patient was staying in an isolated box at the Moscow hospital. She died as a result of pneumonia against the background",0
127,Collaboration To Develop COVID-19 T-cell Therapy,"Baylor College of Medicine is teaming up with AlloVir to work on developing T-cell therapies against the COVID-19 outbreak; this collaboration will build on existing work to develop off the shelf cell therapies that can identify and eliminate specific viruses. AlloVir has been investigating how to help those with weakened immune systems cope with viral pathogens, and have accumulated evidence of improvement in an approach that entails exposing donor T-cells to cytokines that are combined with viral fragments thereby equipping the immune cells to recognize and help eliminate certain pathogens. With the most advanced expression of this approach being Viralym-M T-cell Therapy which was designed to kill 6 viruses that commonly affect immunocompromised patients; the drug was moved into phase 2 in 2014 with enough data to encourage planning of a late phase program. This same approach will be applied to SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells with the goal to create an",0
