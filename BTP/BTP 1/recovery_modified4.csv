128,COVID-19 Stable For Hours To Days On Surfaces,"Recent research published in The New England Journal of Medicine has found that COVID-19 is stable for several hours to even days in aerosols and on surfaces; it was found detectable in aerosols for up to 3 hours, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard, and up to 2-3 days on both plastic and stainless steel surfaces. Scientists from the National Institutes of Health, CDC, UCLA, and Princeton Universities have discovered that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can remain stable for long periods of time on surfaces and in aerosols. Their results may help to provide needed clues to the stability of SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19, and suggests that people may be acquiring the virus through the air as well as after touching contaminated surfaces; this study has been shared widely after the researchers placed it on a preprint server to rapidly share their",0
129,Testing Decisions May Haunt The Nation,"It is common knowledge to get ahead of any epidemic/pandemic that broad screening of the masses is needed for proper tracking and quarantine procedure in efforts to slow spread and contain the virus. If anything has been shown by events over the past few months, American capabilities in this area are very lacking. In February 200 test kits produced by the CDC were distributed to over 100 public health labs across the nation; each containing materials to test 300-400 patients and all labs received the same kits which were distributed to equal locales in all states This decision was prelude to some chaos for the following weeks, in which the availability of the testing was completely out of sync with the number of testing that was and still is needed. South Dakota with few cases may have been getting quick results while areas such as New York, Seattle and San",0

131,Moscow pensioners older than 65 ordered to stay home as part of the struggle against COVID-19,"Moscow pensioners older than 65 ordered to stay home Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has tightened requirements to comply with the regime of high alert in connection with the spread of the novel coronavirus. New restrictions were introduced for individuals over 65 of age, as well as for people with chronic diseases, as well as for families with children. ""The novel coronavirus primarily poses a threat to life and health of the elderly and people with chronic diseases, for people with low immunity. Therefore, our main task is to protect you, Muscovites of older generation,"" Sobyanin wrote on his blog. He noted that many senior citizens do not comply with recommendations of the authorities not to leave home and to limit contacts with other people, even though such activities pose a great risk to their lives. In this regard, from March 26 to April 14, Muscovites suffering from chronic diseases, and",0
138,COVID-19 Diagnostics Still Not Meeting The Demand,"Since being given the green light from the FDA only 10 days ago Roche has delivered over 400,000 COVID-19 test kits to over 30 laboratories across the nation, but it could take weeks to months for the industry as a whole to catch up to the widespread testing that is required. âDemand continues to be much higher than supply,â CEO Severin Schwan said in an interview Monday with CNBC. âThe good news is that, in addition over the last week, other companies have received approval for their respective tests. So we are glad that overall capacity is increasing.â âBut the reality is that broad-based testing is not yet possible,â Schwan said. âItâs really of utmost importance to prioritize testingâto focus testing where we can get the highest impact for patients and the healthcare system. That means we have to prioritize high-risk patients and patients with signs and symptoms of the",0
139,Schools Outâ¦Forever?,"With just about every public school in the country closed at this time, the only way for kids to get an education is at home. Many see this as nothing less than tragic. Writing in Education Week, Stephen Sawchuk claims that schools are an âabsolute necessity for the functioning of civic culture, and even more fundamentally than that, daily life.â If Sawchuk is correct, the countryâs troubles extend way beyond the coronavirus. While shutting down public schools is certainly a massive disruption, our civic culture was just fine before the governmentâs monopoly on education came to be. The push for the governmentâs role in education began in the 1830s when a group of dedicated reformers declared that state involvement was needed to ensure all children get a better, more unified education. Leading the charge was Bostonian Horace Mann who, with likeminded souls, campaigned for a greater state role in education.",0
155,New York Hospitals Utilizing Vitamin C,"New York Stateâs largest hospital system is giving high dose intravenous vitamin C treatments to COVID-19 patients based on reports from China of the approach helping patients there, according to the Post. Pulmonologist and critical care specialists Dr. Andrew G. Weber, who is affiliated with two Northwell Health facilities on Long Island, is reporting that his COVID-19 intensive care patients are immediately receiving 1,500 mgs of vitamin C intravenously and are re-administered the exact amounts 3-4 times per day. Each dose is more than 16 times the national recommended guideline allowances of 90 mg for adult men and 75 mg for adult women. This approach is based on experimental treatments and small studies involving coronavirus patients in Shanghai, China; a hospital even made a release about it. The official statement from Xiâan Jiaotong University Second Hospital reads: âOn the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new",0
165,How the 21st Centuryâs First Major Influenza Outbreak Compares to the Coronavirus Pandemic,"How the 21st Centuryâs First Major Influenza Outbreak Compares to the Coronavirus Pandemic In 2009-2010, more than a quarter of a million people fell victim to the swine flu â a previously unknown strain of influenza that might have infected up to 21% of the planetâs population. As the spread of the coronavirus has accelerated worldwide, many people have discovered or re-watched movies that look strikingly similar to the 2020 real-world pandemic. In Steven Soderberghâs 2011 film âContagionâ, several people â from an unfortunate family in the American Midwest to journalists, doctors and government officials â find themselves in the midst of the outbreak of a terrible disease that suddenly starts killing millions. Freelance journalist, portrayed by Jude Law, describes the situation: âOn day one there were two people, and then four, and then 16. In six months â itâs a billion. Thatâs where weâre headingâ. Sound familiar? But despite",0
166,The Latest HIPAA Updates in Response to COVID-19,"In light of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, government officials, medical professionals, and public health authorities have been forced to navigate an increasingly difficult situation. With a focus on affording the population widespread access to care, many regulations have recently been amended in order to assist the health care system in combating the spread of COVID-19. During an infectious disease outbreak or other emergency situation, it is important for clinicians to continue adhering to official mandates despite the national emergency. As such, the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has recently shared an updated bulletin reminding health care providers of the ways in which patient information can be shared under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. As per the HIPAA rule, the notice recognizes the need for public health officials to have access to protected medical information as a",0
167,Stop the Fear-Mongering! 12 Medical Scientists Speak Out on COVID19 Responses,"Comments by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News Fear over the coronavirus is gripping the nation and world, as within a short period of time life around the globe has drastically changed very suddenly. The main question facing everyone in the U.S. today is: How serious is this? Is the response the government is making right now consistent with the threat this virus presents? Some are proposing that anyone in the media who dares to question the official narrative should be silenced for the sake of âpublic health.â Facebook, for example, took strong actions against Health Impact News by claiming we were publishing âfake news,â mainly by publishing the views of Dr. Andrew W. Saul, Editor of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, who published news about successful intravenous Vitamin C therapy which had started in China. See: And yet this week, the New York Post reported that the same therapy",0
179,Deadly Beast From the Jungle: How the Ebola Outbreaks Differ From the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Deadly Beast From the Jungle: How the Ebola Outbreaks Differ From the COVID-19 Pandemic Since the 1970s, the Ebola virus has been killing thousands of people, primarily in Africa. Despite the relatively low death toll numbers, Ebola has resulted in very high mortality rates in recent decades. In June 1976 an unknown disease started killing people in Sudan. 151 out of 284 patients lost their lives to an illness, which at first looked like common flu. Its main symptoms included fever, sore throat, muscular pain, headache, and fatigue. But within days the disease progressed, with patients starting to suffer from vomiting, combined with internal and external bleeding. The agent that caused the illness was named ""Sudan virus"" and later became part of the larger Ebola virus family. Just like many similar infectious diseases, Ebola is zoonotic in nature, meaning that it jumped from animals to humans. Its potential carriers include",0
181,How to Fight the Coronavirus Naturally,"As this global concern grows by the minute so should your concern to take action into protecting yourself and your loved ones from this worldwide threat. According to the most recently published article by JAMA (An International peer-reviewed medical journal association), the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that results from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Furthermore, the article shares that following initial reports of disease outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread worldwide with cases identified in at least 67 countries across 6 continents. So if this is an acute respiratory illness why is the world-wide population running out of toilet paper? Ok, I must admit this is funny but not really! What is coronavirus disease 2019? According to the CDC, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that can spread from person to person. The virus that causes COVID-19 is a novel",0

189,Covid-19 coronavirus temperature limits: Climate does not matter,"Covid-19 coronavirus temperature limits: Climate does not matter Scientists from the University of Hong Kong have found at which temperatures the novel coronavirus remains most and least active. According to them, the virus remains highly stable for a long time at a temperature of about +4 degrees Celsius. In the absence of disinfection, its activity begins to decline only after 14 days. COVID-19 is very sensitive to high temperatures: it dies within five minutes at +70 Â°C. At +56 Â° C, the virus remains active for less than half an hour, at +37 degrees - for no more than two days, and at a temperature of 22 degrees - for about a week. Scientists find how long coronavirus can live on various surfaces On the outer side of medical masks the virus lives for at least a week at room temperature and relative humidity of 65 percent. Coronavirus stays on",0
195,Americans Will Have To Cure The Coronavirus Epidemic on Their Own,"Original article written by Bill Sardi can be viewed on LewRockwell.com; the following is an excerpt which represents the author's opinion and does not necessarily reflect those of WHN: I penned a prior report, extrapolating from published flu studies, which predicts that 6/10ths-to-1.3% serious side effects after mandated coronavirus vaccination among the nationâs 72.6 million senior adults would hospitalize 435,000-943,000 and a subsequent 1.4% mortality rate would then result in 54,202-111,493 deaths. These hospitalizations and deaths are not necessarily caused by a vaccine, which is always pre-tested for safety among healthy adults who DO respond to vaccination by making antibodies, but from weak immunity among certain known risk groups. Here are four ways the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic could have already been brought to a âdead stop.â 1. Coronaviruses produce seasonal disease, running 5 months from November to the end of March. This is the period when the earth tilts away",0
202,Foods High In Zinc,"We are hearing a lot about zinc in the news lately, and that is because it is an important mineral. Back in 2010 a study published in PLoS Pathogens found ionic zinc was an inhibitor of coronavirus by preventing its replication and spread. Zinc is essential for good health, it helps to metabolize nutrients, maintain the immune system, as well as growing and repairing body tissues. The body does not store zinc so it is important to meet the daily requirements: men 11 mg a day, women 8 mg but 11 while pregnant and 12 while breastfeeding. In vitro cellular testing found that zinc was helpful in preventing a variety of RNA viruses which included poliovirus and influenza; somehow it interfered with the way the viruses process polyproteins which prevented them from doing damage. Other research published in the British Medical Journal identified zinc as a possible treatment against SARS,",0
204,SPEAK WITH YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT YOUR DRUGS THAT MAY INCREASE RISK OF SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) INFECTION,"Article courtesy of: Charles B. Simone, M.MS, M.D DRUGS INCREASE ACE2 THAT IS NEEDED BY SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 Coronavirus) TO ATTACH AND INFECT CELLS of the lung, intestine, kidney, blood vessel. The more ACE2, the more infection. This may be the reason why the elderly who are treated with these drugs, have a greater risk of death / severe side effects. A joint opinion statement about this topic was issued on March 17, 2020 by the American College Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the Heart Failure Society of America: ""The continued highest standard of care for cardiovascular disease patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is top priority, but there are no experimental or clinical data demonstrating beneficial or adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients using ACE-I or ARB medications,"" said Richard J. Kovacs, MD, FACC. ""We urge urgent, additional research that can guide us to optimal care for the millions of people worldwide with",0
226,HCQ Effective For COVID-19 In Small Trial,"Patients in China with COVID-19 treated with HCQ/hydroxychloroquine were observed to have a shorter time to clinical recovery as well as improved pneumonia in a randomized trial. HCQ is an antimalarial that is also used to treat autoimmune diseases such as lupus. Those that received hydroxychloroquine with standard treatment were observed to have had a significantly shorter time to body temperature recovery of about one day as well as a significantly reduced time to cough remission of about a day compared to patients receiving only the standard treatment according to reports from Zhan Zhang, MD of Wuhan University. A larger proportion of patients in the group receiving the hydroxychloroquine with standard treatment had improved pneumonia compared to those in the control group, according to a manuscript posted on the medRxiv preprint server. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been getting much attention lately, and the FDA is looking into conducting randomized trials",0
227,Updated Practice Management Guidelines for Healthcare Facilities,"Healthcare providers today have found themselves in the midst of an unprecedented public health emergency requiring the combined efforts of the entire workforce. In times like these, clear and effective guidance is a necessity. To assist clinicians with navigating this challenging landscape, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have released interim guidelines outlining preparation strategies for healthcare facilities anticipating community spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and those which may be experiencing it currently. As the situation is unfolding dynamically it is impossible to predict the course of the outbreak and the medical workforceâs preparedness is vital to improving patient outcomes. The CDC stresses the importance of continual care for all patients, despite a surge in demand at healthcare facilities, and the need for concentrated efforts aimed at mobilizing all aspects of the system to reduce the spread of COVID-19 while decreasing its burden. As the situation continues to",0
