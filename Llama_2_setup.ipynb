Travel bans have been put in place and extended from central China to effectively put tens of millions of people in local lockdown. The virus was first detected in Wuhan where workers are racing to build a thousand bed hospital to treat patients affected by the disease. All around China, including in the capital Beijing authorities are cancelling all temple fairs and festivals that would accompany the Spring Festival to avoid having large public gathering which would create the perfect scenario for the airborne virus to spread further.
