# Generating-and-detecting-misinformation-with-large-language-model-driven-AI-chatbots

BTech Thesis Project under Prof. Mainack Mondal, IIT Kharagpur

• Utilized Llama-2-13b-chat to generate deceptive tweets using personas, implemented a pipeline to detect misinformation
• Covid-Twitter-BERT outperformed the top performer in CLEF-2022 with F1-score of 0.71 in check-worthiness detection
• Developed a veracity prediction pipeline using Sentence-BERT and cosine similarity, achieving an F1 score of 69.41
• Found 13% of tweets misclassified as true in human evaluation, revealing pipeline’s susceptibility to severe misinformation
