# Generating-and-detecting-misinformation-with-large-language-model-driven-AI-chatbots

BTech Thesis Project under Prof. Mainack Mondal, IIT Kharagpur

• Utilized LLMs (e.g., chatGPT and llama) to produce misinformation, developed a classifier to discern truth from falsehood 

• Validated the classifier's accuracy by evaluating its performance on some datasets containing instances of misinformation

• Investigated the effectiveness of integrating an accurate statement with misinformation to construct deceptive "half truth"

• Employed these partial truths strategically to evaluate the susceptibility of the classifier to this form of manipulation
